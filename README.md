# PLATR 🍽️

PLATR is a short-form food discovery platform where users explore dishes through reel-style videos instead of long reviews or static images. The goal is simple: help people decide *what to eat* faster.

This project focuses on building a scalable, real-world MERN application with clean architecture, clear separation of concerns, and production-style practices.

## Why PLATR?

Most food platforms rely on text-heavy reviews that are slow to consume and often outdated. PLATR flips that model by using short, vertical videos to capture the look, preparation, and appeal of a dish in seconds.

This repository is built as a **portfolio-grade project**, not a demo or clone.
